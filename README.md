# makemore_series

This repo is intended on being a step by step reconstruction of Andrej Karpathy's makemore series, with different changes for educational purpose. 
Since the main purpose of the project is educational, some OOP principles have been ignored for efficiency and time reasons. The project served 
both studying the underlying mechanisms of (but not limited to) language  models and studying and getting familiar with the PyTorch framework.
